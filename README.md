Groestlcoin EasyMiner - V 1.1
==============

Minimal clicking GroestlCoin miner 

This miner is supposed to be as simple as possible and it mines directly to an electrum wallet that is set up during initial run.

GroestlCoin Easyminer is intended to bring Groestlcoin mining to everyone who has yet to get into cryptocurrencies because mining was too complex or too time-consuming for them. They should be able to run a file with minimal installation and immediately begin making that “magic internet money”.

To start using run the RunMe.vbs file. 

On your desktop you should also see a Electrum-GRSWallet.exe file after you run the script the first time.

That is where your mined GroestlCoin will be deposited.
